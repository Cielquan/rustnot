_Don't rust. Stand up._

This tool is just a simple programm running in the background and remindining you to
stand up and sit back down via desktop notifications.

Reason for this is I have a desk which can be used while standing or sitting and while
working long hours at my PC I tend to forget to change positions once in a while to
relax my back.
